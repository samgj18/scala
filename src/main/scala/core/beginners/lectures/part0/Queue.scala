/** # Queue Data Structure
  *
  * A `Queue` is a `linear data structure` that follows the principle <b>First
  * In First Out</b> [FIFO].This means that the first inserted element is the
  * first to be removed.
  *
  * A good representation of a Queue is a queue in the bank, first who get the
  * ticket is the first to get called
  *
  * ```
  * -o   o   o   o   o
  * /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\ /|\
  * / \ / \ / \ / \ / \
  * ```
  *
  * # Operations
  *
  * A queue is an object (an abstract data structure - ADT) that allows the
  * following operations:
  *
  *   - Enqueue: Add an element to the end of the queue
  *   - Dequeue: Remove an element from the front of the queue
  *   - IsEmpty: Check if the queue is empty
  *   - IsFull: Check if the queue is full
  *   - Peek: Get the value of the front of the queue without removing it
